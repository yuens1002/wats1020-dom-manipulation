          Grace Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral.
          She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and the one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (inspired by an actual moth removed from the computer). Owing to the breadth of her accomplishments and her naval rank, she is sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace". The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper (DDG-70) is named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.

        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p class="teaser">Hopper was known for popularizing the term "bug" in software development.</p>
        <p class="details" id="detail1"><img class="pull-right img-thumbnail" src="img/bug.jpg">While she was working on a Mark II Computer at a US Navy research lab in Dahlgren, Virginia in 1947, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were "debugging" the system. Though the term bug had been in use for many years in engineering to refer to small glitches and inexplicable problems, Admiral Hopper did bring the term into popularity. The remains of the moth can be found in the group's log book at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <img class="pull-right img-thumbnail" src="img/hopper_speaking.jpg">
          Here are three of her most famous quotes:
          <blockquote>The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>You manage things; you lead people.</blockquote>
